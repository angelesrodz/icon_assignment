<div id="paragraph1"> The South Bronx area in New York City is historically composed of a diverse ethnic, racial, cultural and Spanish linguistic background. To meet their community’s higher education needs, the Eugenio Maria de Hostos Community College was born in 1968 as a way for Black, Puerto Rican and other Hispanic groups to achieve their education and career goals. Hostos provided bilingual courses taught in Spanish and English so that Hispanic students that did not dominate the English language could learn in their native language. </div>

<br>

 <div id="paragraph2"> Sadly, this Dual language college education is diminishing as school years go by, undeserving hispanic students. Resources such as courses taught in Spanish and not having Spanish translators on their staff have been progressively eliminated. While Hostos does have an English-as-a-Second-Language program to help students obtain a better understanding of the language, it isn’t enough. The data below shows population shifts in the Bronx County and the involvement of Hostos Community College, especially for Hispanic students, during the last two decades. </div>

<div class="main-container"> 

<div class="flex-container"><img src="ICONS/census.png"> Per USA Facts, by 1990 the Hispanic/Latino community and African Americans were 43.6% and 31% respectively. This has shifted to a steady growth for Hispanic/Latino group to 56.4% and a slight decrease on the African American group to 29.1% by 2020.</div>


<div class="flex-container"><img src="ICONS/young_adult.png"> The population ages decreased in the age groups of 20 to 34 years old.  In 1990 this age group was 26.5% and decreased to 23.1% in 2000.   By 2010 it decreased to 22.9% and has steadily reduced to currently being 22.4% in 2020. </div>


<div class="flex-container"><img src="ICONS/latino-black.png"> According to Datawheel, 62.2% of the Hostos Community College student population were Hispanic or Latino, while 27.2% were Black or African American. </div>


<div class="flex-container"><img src="ICONS/decrease.png"> For their current 28 associate degree programs, Hostos Community College offers Spanish/English bilingual education. Records from the College Catalog showed that between 1999 to 2016, the institution offered between 23 to 30 courses in Spanish every year.  In the 2020-2022 catalog, only 19 courses are available out of the 588 courses taught at the community college.  This represents a decrease of approximately 30% in their Spanish offerings. </div>
  
  
<div class="flex-container"><img src="ICONS/spanish.png"> Through the years, the Spanish course decrease was noticed in the Biology courses which in early 2000 had 2 courses, increasing to 5 courses by 2016.  The academic years of 2020-2022  do not include Spanish language Biology classes. </div>
